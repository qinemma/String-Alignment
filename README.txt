1. To compile codes, user can either compile them java way, or through shell scripts. 
Two Shell Scripts are included in the folder: one is for local alignment and another
is for global alignment.

2. Alignments only return one possible optimal alignment between two input
strings not all, which depends on hierarchy of traceback.

3. To read files of DNA sequence and scoring matrix, I use Parser.java, a class I wrote to  scan and read files in specific layout.
